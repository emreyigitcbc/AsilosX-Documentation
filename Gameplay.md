# Gameplay
To start playing you must born in Asilvillage. To born, you have to use `x!asillage` command. This command will prepare you.
After using this command, your main goal is being `Elder Asil`.

Sometimes, the bot may not born you or born you half. Then, you can use `x!checkborn`.

To be `Elder Asil`, you have to adopt own pet, fight other pets and be the best! When  you reach `30 level` as player (not your pet), you will be `Elder Asil`.


After you became `Elder Asil`, you can go another Asil villages... (Not supported yet)

Now, when you prepared you will be in `Asillage Square`, first you have to talk with villagers to get information. Every information that you will get, will be stored in your mind. To think informations, you have to type `x!informations`.
Every information that you got is very precisius because sometimes you will need them to get some hidden places or forge weapons and armors. Sometimes, you have to remember your informations because you may forget them... Not to forget them you have to type `x!informations`.

When you search are, you will think "what to do?" or "where to go?". You have to type your decision and every decision you made has chances to give you something or nothing.

Every option in the question will be labeled as a, b, c or d in background and they will labeled randomly. (If you have better `LUCK` you may get more good things)

If you selected a labeled option, you will get good things.

If you selected b labeled option, you will get avarage thing.
